This library provides [MediaRouter][4], [MediaRouteProvider][5], and related media classes.

In general, the APIs in the v7 mediarouter library provide a means of controlling the routing of media channels and streams from the current device to external screens, speakers, and other destination devices. The library includes APIs for publishing app-specific media route providers, for discovering and selecting destination devices, for checking media status, and more. For detailed information about the v7 mediarouter library APIs, see the [android.support.v7.media][7] package in the API reference.
